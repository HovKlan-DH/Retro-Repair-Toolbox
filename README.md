# Retro Repair Toolbox

_Retro Repair Toolbox_ (or **RRT** hence forward) is a utility tool for repairing and diagnosing vintage computers and peripherals.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that this is currently in active DEVELOPMENT, and not all functionalities are working.

The project is a direct spin-off from my other project, [Commodore Repair Toolbox](https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Commodore-Repair-Toolbox) (**CRT**) and once the development finalizes for **RRT**, then the **CRT** project will get archived on GitHub and this new project will take over.
